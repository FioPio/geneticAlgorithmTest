# geneticAlgorithmTest

This small project is a self project to get more knowledge on genetic algorithms. It was inspired by one of the videos of "The Coding Train" youtube channel.

## Bugs
Right now the only known bug is that the fit function should be modifyed to have in account the distance traveled, because it generates a very oscilating path.
